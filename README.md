# Vernissage

Vernissage is a portfolio platform that lets users share their art with everyone. The user can log in to the application or register a new account. Once logged in, the user can select a project from the list of previously uploaded artworks on the home page. Each project includes a title and images. Titles and descriptions can be assigned for each image individually.

The user can search for an artist by their name. On the artist page, the user can view the artist's previous projects and a short introduction.

Registered users can share their own projects by uploading a cover picture for the project itself and, for every image, a title and a description.

On the user's own profile, they can change their profile picture or edit their introduction section.

## Target audience
